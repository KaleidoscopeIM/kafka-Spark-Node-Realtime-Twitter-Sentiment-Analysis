# kafka-Spark-Node-Realtime-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
The project aims to design an app to fetch Twitter live data using Kafka broker and Spark streams and then perform in place sentiment analysis. The project starts a node server, in the end, to display the final analyzed data onto a locally hosted web app.
